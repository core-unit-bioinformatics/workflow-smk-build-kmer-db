# the all vs all comparison by file
# or sample can result in thousands
# of jobs. Snakemake's batch function
# does not really alleviate the problem
# of a large setup times because there
# are not intermediate aggregation rules.
# Hence, if the following value is larger 0,
# the combinations will be randomly
# downsampled to this fraction per run (0 ... 1).
# Eventually, Snakemake must be executed with
# downsample_comparisons: 0
# to finalize the workflow run.
