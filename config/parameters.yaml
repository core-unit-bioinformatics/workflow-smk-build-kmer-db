# for operations that use a minimum
# value for the k-mer multiplicity
# (frequency) to subset a k-mer
# database to a more reliable set
# (fewer error k-mers), force this
# threshold instead of using a
# data-derived one. Setting this
# to -1 deactivates the option.
# Setting this to zero uses all
# k-mers, which should be done
# if the workflow input consists
# of virtually error-free sequence
# data. If the 'always' option is
# set to True, the threshold is
# enforced for all k-mer databases,
# even if a reliable k-mer threshold
# can be inferred from the data
# (i.e., 'always' overrides any data-derived
# k-mer frequency threshold)

# 1) kmerfreqt_always: force threshold

# 3) kmerfreqt_only_fail: enforce threshold for fails
